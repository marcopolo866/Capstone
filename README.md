# Large-Language Model Generated C++ Code 

Large-Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly competent, prevalent, and affordable. If LLMs can be shown as effective in a workflow, they can be used to increase efficiency for programmers on more tedious or obscure tasks. We will be rigorously testing LLM-generated code for weighted-graph problems against standardized benchmarks with minimal human refactoring. Metrics of interest will include runtime, memory use, scalability curves, etc. Based on the programâ€™s performance, we can begin to estimate the effectiveness of LLM-generated code. If LLM-generated code performs well, we may recommend integration into programming workflows. If it performs poorly, we may advise against using LLMs in programming work.
